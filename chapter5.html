        <h1>Chapter 5: Programming Concepts and Logic</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Every computerized device needs instructions to perform tasks. These instructions are written in a <strong>programming language</strong>. Programs are sets of instructions that tell a computer what actions to perform, and when combined, they make up software. The computer doesn't understand programming languages directly; instead, it requires a <strong>language translator</strong> such as an <strong>assembler</strong>, <strong>compiler</strong>, or <strong>interpreter</strong> to convert high-level languages into machine language.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program written by the programmer is called the <strong>source program</strong>. After being translated, it becomes a machine-understandable <strong>object program</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Qualities of Good Programs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Understandability:</strong> The program should be easy to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> The program must be error-free.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The program should perform its function consistently and correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> It should be easy to use and navigate.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> The program should be flexible enough to run on different systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
            Programming languages are used to communicate instructions to a computer. These languages consist of a set of keywords, variables, operators, and other elements such as loops and conditions that help in forming instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process of writing programs is called <strong>programming</strong>, and the person who writes programs is called a <strong>programmer</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
            Programming languages can be categorized into <strong>low-level</strong> and <strong>high-level</strong> languages.
        </p>

        <h3>Low-level Language</h3>
        <p>Low-level languages are machine-dependent, meaning programs written for one type of system cannot be run on another system. Programming in low-level languages is more difficult and time-consuming.</p>
        
        <h4>Types of Low-level Languages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine-level Language (1GL):</strong> Uses binary code (0’s and 1’s), understood directly by the processor, but difficult to write and debug.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly Language (2GL):</strong> Uses mnemonics like ADD, SUB, etc., which are easier to understand than binary code but still require knowledge of the system's architecture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>High-level Language</h3>
        <p>High-level languages are closer to human languages (like English), which makes them easier to use for writing and debugging programs. They are machine-independent, meaning programs can run on different processors without modification.</p>
        
        <h4>Types of High-level Languages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Procedural-oriented Languages (3GL):</strong> Focuses on the procedure (steps) to be followed, e.g., C, FORTRAN.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem/ Object-oriented Languages (4GL):</strong> Focuses on data rather than procedures and supports data encapsulation, inheritance, etc., e.g., Java, C++.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Languages (5GL):</strong> Uses simple, natural statements for communication, still in development stage, e.g., PROLOG.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Language Translators/Processors</h2>
        <p>To convert programs written in assembly or high-level languages into machine language, we use language translators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assembler:</strong> Converts assembly language into machine language.</li>
            <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> Converts the entire program from high-level language to machine language at once (e.g., C, C++).</li>
            <li><strong>Interpreter:</strong> Converts one line or statement at a time and executes it immediately (e.g., BASIC, PHP).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Syntax and Semantics</h2>
        <p>In programming, <strong>syntax</strong> refers to the rules that govern the structure of statements in a program. <strong>Semantics</strong> refers to the meaning of individual statements or symbols used in the program.</p>
        <p>Example in QBasic:</p>
        <code>Print "This is programming";</code>
        <p>In this example, <strong>Print</strong> is the semantics, and the entire line is the <strong>syntax</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Errors (BUGS)</h2>
        <p>Errors in a program are called <strong>bugs</strong>, and the process of removing them is called <strong>debugging</strong>. There are three types of errors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Syntax Error:</strong> Errors due to incorrect syntax (e.g., missing semicolons).</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Error:</strong> Errors due to incorrect logic (e.g., incorrect formula for calculation).</li>
            <li><strong>Runtime Error:</strong> Errors that occur during program execution (e.g., insufficient memory).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Terminology in Programming</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Types:</strong> Specifies the type of data used in a program, e.g., Numeric, Character.</p>
        <p><strong>Variable:</strong> Entities that hold values and can change during program execution.</p>
        <p><strong>Constant:</strong> Entities that hold fixed values throughout program execution.</p>
        <p><strong>Operands:</strong> The values or variables on which operators perform actions.</p>
        <p><strong>Operators:</strong> Special symbols that represent actions (e.g., +, -, *, /).</p>

        <h2>Program Design Tools</h2>
        <p>There are several tools used for designing programs, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> A step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Flowchart:</strong> A graphical representation of the steps in a program.</li>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> A simplified version of the program written in plain language.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Algorithm Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It should execute output after a finite number of steps.</li>
            <li>It should not depend on any specific programming language.</li>
            <li>It should terminate after a finite number of steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Chapter 5: Algorithms, Flowcharts, and C Programming</h1>

        <h2>Algorithm Examples</h2>

        <h3>1. Write an algorithm to calculate simple interest</h3>
        <pre>
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the value of P, T, R
Step 3: Calculate simple interest by using i = (P * T * R) / 100
Step 4: Display simple interest (i)
Step 5: Stop
        </pre>

        <h3>2. Write an algorithm to check the greatest number among two numbers</h3>
        <pre>
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read any two numbers a, b
Step 3: Check if (a > b)
    If yes, Display "The greatest number is a" and go to step 4
    If no, Display "The greatest number is b" and go to step 4
Step 4: Stop
        </pre>

        <h2>Flowchart</h2>
        <p>It is a diagrammatic or pictorial representation of the steps involved in an algorithm for solving a particular problem. There are two types of flowcharts:</p>
        
        <h3>a. Program Flowchart</h3>
        <p>It is a type of flowchart which focuses on a specific problem. This type of flowchart portrays only a single task (logic) at a time.</p>

        <h4>Symbols used in Flowchart:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Start/End: Represented by an oval symbol</li>

        <img src="example-system-flowchart.png" alt="System Flowchart Example" />

        <h2>C Programming Language</h2>
        <p>The C programming language is a high-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the 1970s. It is a very powerful language, used for both system programming and application programming, and often known as a "middle-level" language.</p>

        <h3>Features of C Language</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Supports both high-level and low-level programming</li>
            <li>Commonly used for system programming and application programming</li>
            <li>Offers fast and efficient program development</li>
            <li>Has powerful tools and keywords</li>
            <li>Uses its own text editor and compiler</li>
            <li>Supports structured programming</li>
            <li>Portable across different systems</li>
            <li>Has a powerful set of library functions</li>
            <li>Flexible in programming</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of C Language</h3>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Suitable for system programming</li>

            <li>Easy to learn</li>
            <li>Compact and efficient code</li>
            <li>Secure program code</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>No runtime checking</li>
            <li>No strict data type checking</li>
            <li>Debugging becomes complex as the program grows</li>
            <li>Requires semicolons for each statement</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>C Language Terminology</h2>

        <h3>Define the Following Terms</h3>

        <h4>a) Editor</h4>
        <p>The editor is the area where you type the program. While C language has its own text editor, any text editor can also be used.</p>

        <h4>b) Pre-processor</h4>
        <p>A pre-processor is a set of complex codes that instruct the machine to understand specific keywords. For example, #include tells the compiler to use header files like "stdio.h".</p>

        <h4>c) Compiler</h4>
        <p>A compiler converts source code written in a high-level programming language into machine-readable code (object code).</p>

        <h4>d) Linker</h4>
        <p>A linker is software that links library files with object code to create an executable file (with a .exe extension).</p>

        <h3>Fundamentals of C</h3>

        <h4>Character Set</h4>
        <p>The character set is the collection of alphabets, digits, whitespace characters, and special symbols used in programming. C uses the following character set:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alphabets: A-Z, a-z</li>
            <li>Digits: 0-9</li>
            <li>Special Symbols: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - _ + = | \ { } [] : ; " ' <> , . ? /</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Comment</h4>
        <p>Comments are non-executable text in a program used to provide explanations for other developers or programmers. There are two types of comments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-line comment: // Comment text here</li>
            <li>Multi-line comment: /* Comment text here */</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>C Tokens</h4>
        <p>The set of identifiers, keywords, constants, variables, and operators used in C programming are called C Tokens.</p>

        <h4>Identifiers</h4>
        <p>Identifiers are names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, and arrays.</p>

        <h4>Keywords</h4>
        <p>Keywords are reserved words in C that cannot be used as identifiers. Examples: int, void, if, else, while, for.</p>

        <h4>Data Types in C</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>int</strong>: Represents integer values (whole numbers), uses 2 bytes of memory.</li>
            <li><strong>float</strong>: Represents floating-point values (decimal numbers), uses 4 bytes of memory.</li>
            <li><strong>char</strong>: Represents a single character, uses 1 byte of memory.</li>
            <li><strong>void</strong>: Represents an absence of value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Constants and Variables</h4>
        <p>Constants are fixed values, while variables are used to store data that can change during program execution.</p>

        <h4>Operators</h4>
        <p>Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and constants. Examples include arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.</p>

        <h4>Escape Sequences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>\n</strong>: New line</li>
            <li><strong>\t</strong>: Horizontal tab</li>
            <li><strong>\0</strong>: Null character</li>
            <li><strong>\\</strong>: Backslash</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Library Functions</h4>
        <p>Functions are blocks of code that can be used to perform a task. Examples: printf(), scanf(), strlen().</p>

        <h2>Sample Program in C</h2>

        <pre>
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int a, b, sum;
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &b);
    sum = a + b;
    printf("The sum is %d", sum);
