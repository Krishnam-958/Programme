    <h1>Chapter 8: Information Security and Cyber Law</h1>


<section>
    <h2>1. What is Information Technology? Describe it with its social impacts.</h2>
    <p>Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is a combined form of Information and Communication Technology, widely used for the flow of information and in many other fields. IT has brought the world closer, enabling easy communication across the globe in a matter of seconds. It has a wide range of applications in education, industries, banking, research centers, hospitals, and more.</p>
    <p>IT is used as a learning and teaching tool in education, enabling distant learning. It helps industries to control the quantity and quality of products. In healthcare, IT is used for managing hospital systems and aiding patient treatment. IT also plays a vital role in animation and entertainment, as well as in scientific research and space technology. While IT has had a positive impact, it has also led to an increase in cybercrimes, such as data theft, information disclosure, and virus spreading, which can disturb social peace and security.</p>

    <h2>Information Security</h2>
    <p>Information security refers to protecting networks, systems, and data from unauthorized access, misuse, or destruction. With the rise of cyber threats, it's crucial to adopt security measures to prevent attacks, both intentional and accidental. Information security ensures a secure environment for computer users and programs.</p>
    <p>Information security aims to mitigate security threats and attacks. A security threat refers to a potential danger, while a security attack is an actual attempt to access or alter information maliciously. These attacks can include viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and worms.</p>
    <h3>Objectives of Information Security:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that data is accurate and complete, and cannot be tampered with by unauthorized users.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information is available to authorized users whenever needed.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Cryptography</h2>
    <p>Cryptography, derived from the Greek word meaning “secret writing,” is the science of securing communication and information. It involves the process of encrypting (transforming readable text into unreadable text) and decrypting (converting unreadable text back into readable text) data to protect it from unauthorized access. This is commonly done using algorithms and keys. Encryption ensures that messages remain unreadable to anyone trying to intercept them, and decryption reverses this process to recover the original message.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. What is Digital Divide?</h2>
    <p>Digital Divide refers to the gap between individuals who have access to information technology (IT) and those who do not. This gap exists between people who are computer literate and those who are not, and it is often observed between urban and rural populations, as well as between different economic and educational groups. The term was first coined in the 1990s, and bridging this gap has become a global challenge. Governments are working to ensure more equitable access to IT in order to reduce the divide.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. What are the computer ethics or cyber ethics?</h2>
    <p>Computer ethics or cyber ethics refers to the set of moral principles or codes of conduct that should be followed by computer professionals and users to prevent criminal activities in the digital realm. Some key examples of cyber ethics include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not use others’ passwords.</li>
        <li>Do not steal others’ information.</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to harm others.</li>
        <li>Do not disclose others’ secrets.</li>
        <li>Do not spread viruses in the network.</li>
        <li>Do not copy licensed software without paying.</li>
        <li>Do not alter others’ data without permission.</li>
        <li>Do not take possession of others’ intellectual property.</li>
        <li>Do not misuse electronic transactions.</li>
        <li>Do not use computers to bear false witness.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. What is Cyber Crime? List out some examples of Cyber Crimes.</h2>
    <p>Cybercrime refers to any illegal activity involving computers, the Internet, or electronic media. As the use of Information Technology grows, so does the prevalence of cybercrimes. Some common examples of cybercrimes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Misuse of computers.</li>
        <li>Spreading viruses.</li>
        <li>Stealing others’ information.</li>
        <li>Pirating licensed software.</li>
        <li>Disclosing others’ secrecy.</li>
        <li>Misuse of electronic transactions and media.</li>
        <li>Racial or communal hate speech on the Internet.</li>
        <li>Alteration of others’ data without permission.</li>
        <li>Spying on others’ information.</li>
        <li>Hacking or cracking.</li>
        <li>Password guessing.</li>
        <li>Salami saving and data diddling.</li>
        <li>Forgery.</li>
        <li>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. What is Cyber Law? Define and write some provisions of it.</h2>
    <p>Cyber law refers to the legal regulations and provisions concerning the use of computers, the Internet, and electronic media, specifically for the protection of information and the prevention of cybercrimes. Cyber law defines punishments for the violation of cyber ethics and the misuse of technology. In Nepal, the government passed the Cyber Law, known as the "Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005," on 18th March 2005.</p>
    <h3>Some Provisions of Cyber Law include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Electronic and Digital Signature Law.</li>
        <li>Intellectual Property Laws, including Copyright, Trademark, and Patent Law.</li>
        <li>Telecommunication Law.</li>
        <li>Data Protection and Privacy Laws.</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2>6. Explain the different objectives of IT Policy of Nepal.</h2>
    <p>The IT policies of Nepal aim to enhance the use of Information Technology in the country for economic growth and social inclusion. Some key objectives are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To declare IT as a high-priority sector of the government and make it practical.</li>
