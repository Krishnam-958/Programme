    <h1>Chapter 7: Multimedia</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Multimedia consists of two words: ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’. "Multi" means many, and "Media" refers to the way/medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms. The information can be expressed in text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.</p>
    <p>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and greater understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) by using multimedia computer systems. The integration of different forms of media is mandatory for effective communication.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Components of Multimedia System</h2>
    <p>Multimedia computer systems consist of both multimedia hardware and multimedia software.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Printer, projector, webcam, microphone, digital camera, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Text editor (MS Word), Presentation tool (PowerPoint), Photo editing (Photoshop), Video editing (iMovie), Accounting package (Tally), etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These multimedia hardware and software work together to integrate several components of multimedia. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of Multimedia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It helps to make communication much more effective.</li>
        <li>It enhances the level of understanding in any particular topic.</li>
        <li>Games, cartoons, and movies are made more effective and realistic by using multimedia.</li>
        <li>It makes the teaching and learning process much more interesting and intuitive.</li>
        <li>Virtual reality and simulation have become more realistic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages of Multimedia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Multimedia components may be expensive.</li>
        <li>Technical knowledge and IT literacy are required to operate multimedia.</li>
        <li>Technology is always changing and never constant.</li>
        <li>Multimedia devices run on electricity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>
    <h3>Text</h3>
    <p>Text is the collection of alphanumeric values or any characters. It can be a word, a single line, or a paragraph. Text is the basic form of expressing information and can be customized in size, color, type, and style using text editors like MS-Word, Notepad, etc.</p>
    <p>Text documents usually have extensions like <code>.docx</code>, <code>.txt</code>, etc.</p>

    <h3>Graphics/Images</h3>
    <p>A picture is worth a thousand words, meaning images can describe things more efficiently than text. Graphics generally refer to images or pictures, where the smallest element of a picture is called a Pixel (Picture Element). The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels it contains.</p>
    <p>Examples of image formats include <code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.png</code>, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Audio</h3>
    <p>Audio is an important component of multimedia that gives the sensation of hearing. It can be human voice, instrument notes, natural sound, or digitally synthesized sound. Audio can be transmitted digitally and is commonly used in FM radio.</p>
    <p>Examples of audio formats include <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wma</code>, etc.</p>

    <h3>Video</h3>
    <p>Video is a series of still images (frames) shown at a high speed to create the illusion of movement. The smoothness of a video is measured in frames per second (FPS). Standard FPS rates include 30 and 60 FPS for different devices.</p>
    <p>Examples of video formats include <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mpeg</code>, etc.</p>

    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <p>Animation is a sequence of computer-generated images displayed rapidly to provide visual effects. These images are typically created to express ideas that require complex explanations. Animation can be 2D or 3D, with 3D animation being more realistic in nature.</p>
    <p>Examples of animation formats include <code>.flv</code>, <code>.gif</code>, etc.</p>
