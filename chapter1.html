    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computare," which means to calculate. It accepts raw data (input), processes it as per the user’s command, stores it, and outputs meaningful information. Computers follow the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle and the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle, meaning the quality of output depends on the quality of input.</p>

    </section>
    <h1>Computer System Components</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Input Unit</h2>
        <p>Data and instruction must enter the computer system before any computation can be performed on the supplied data. The input device accepts data and instruction from the user, which are then converted into a suitable form that is accepted by the computer system. The input unit acts as an interface/bridge for communication between the user and the computer system. Below are the functions performed by the input unit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It accepts the list of instructions and data from the outside world.</li>
            <li>It converts the supplied instructions and data into a computer-acceptable form (binary code).</li>
            <li>It supplies the converted instructions and data to the computer system for further processing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some commonly used input devices include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard, trackpad, touchscreen, mouse, light pen, scanner, BCR, MICR, OCR, joystick, trackball, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Output Unit</h2>
        <p>The job of an output unit is the reverse of the input unit. It supplies information and results of computation to the outside world. It consists of devices that translate information processed by the computer into a form that humans can understand. The computer-processed information consists of 0s and 1s, which need to be translated into letters, numbers, special symbols, pictures, etc., that people can understand. Below are the functions performed by the output unit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It accepts the result produced by the computer, which is not understandable to us.</li>
            <li>It converts the result into a human-understandable form.</li>
            <li>It supplies the converted results to the outside world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Commonly used output devices include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor, printers, speakers, plotters, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Output Devices</h3>
        <p>There are two types of output devices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Copy Output:</strong> These outputs are in print form on paper or some other material that can be touched and carried to be shown to others. It is permanent in nature and doesn't require continuous power supply. Examples: Output produced by a printer or plotter.</li>
            <li><strong>Soft Copy Output:</strong> Soft copy output refers to data shown on a display screen or produced by a speaker. It is untouchable and temporary. It only exists while there is a computer or continuous electric supply. Examples: Output produced on a monitor or sound produced by speakers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of any computer system. It carries out major calculations and comparisons. It is responsible for activating and controlling the operation of other units of a computer system. A microprocessor is a single chip that performs the function of the CPU in micro-computers. The speed of the microprocessor is measured in Megahertz (MHz) and Gigahertz (GHz). The functions of the CPU (processor) are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To carry out processing.</li>
            <li>To give commands and coordinate with all other parts of the computer system.</li>
            <li>To control the sequence of operations in the computer system.</li>
            <li>To help with memory allocation and control the storage of data and instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Components of CPU</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> The CU manages and coordinates the operations of the computer system, interpreting instructions and issuing signals for the other units to execute them.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Unit (MU):</strong> The memory unit stores data and instructions, either temporarily or permanently. The primary memory stores data temporarily, while the secondary memory stores processed data permanently.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Memory Unit</h2>
        <h3>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</h3>
        <p>Primary Memory is the memory that stores data and instructions currently being used by the computer. It is faster but usually volatile (except for ROM). It is usually smaller and more expensive than secondary storage. Features of primary memory include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is not used to store data permanently.</li>
            <li>It is usually volatile, except for ROM.</li>
            <li>It is faster than secondary storage.</li>
            <li>It is typically smaller in capacity.</li>
            <li>It is made of semiconducting materials.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
      <h1>Computer Memory and Classification</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Primary Memory</h2>
        <p>Primary memory is used to store data and instructions temporarily. It is volatile, meaning data is lost when the power is turned off. There are two main types of primary memory:</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
        <p>RAM stores data and instructions temporarily and is volatile. A user can both read from and write to it. It is also known as read-write memory. There are two types of RAM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SRAM (Static Random Access Memory):</strong> Made up of transistors, it does not require refreshing to retain its content, making it faster but more power-consuming.</li>
            <li><strong>DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory):</strong> Made up of capacitors, it needs periodic refreshing to retain its content. It is slower than SRAM but consumes less power and is less expensive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 ROM (Read Only Memory)</h3>
        <p>ROM is non-volatile memory used to store data permanently. Data and instructions in ROM remain intact even after power is turned off. The program stored in ROM is called firmware and is responsible for booting the computer. There are several types of ROM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory):</strong> A blank chip that can only be written once using a special machine. Once written, it cannot be modified.</li>
            <li><strong>EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):</strong> A chip that can be reprogrammed after erasing its content using ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li><strong>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):</strong> A chip that can be erased and reprogrammed repeatedly with electric pulses, without needing to be removed from the system.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Secondary Memory</h2>
        <p>Secondary memory is used to store data permanently for future reference. Unlike primary memory, it is non-volatile and retains data even when the power is turned off. Some commonly used secondary storage types include:</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Magnetic Storage</h3>
        <p>In magnetic storage, data is stored in the form of magnetic spots. A magnetic material coating, such as ferric oxide, is used to store data on a disk. Examples of magnetic storage media include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Disk:</strong> A sealed storage device made up of multiple magnetic disks (platters) mounted on a spindle. It is used to store large volumes of data permanently. It consists of tracks and sectors to organize the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Floppy Disk:</strong> A flat, round disk coated with magnetic material, used for both reading and writing data. It has small storage compared to hard disks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Optical Storage</h3>
        <p>Optical storage uses laser beams to read and write data. It is also non-volatile and widely used for storing large amounts of data. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CD-ROM (Compact Disk - Read Only Memory):</strong> A storage medium that can hold up to 700 MB of data, typically used for storing software, audio, and video content.</li>
            <li><strong>DVD (Digital Versatile Disk):</strong> A type of optical storage that can store much larger amounts of data than a CD, making it ideal for video and large files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Flash Memory</h3>
        <p>Flash memory is a non-volatile, erasable, and programmable solid-state memory made from semiconductor chips. It is known for its speed and can be reprogrammed without special equipment. Examples include memory cards and USB drives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Classification of Computers Based on Size</h2>
        <p>Computers are classified based on their size, processing power, and storage capacity. The main categories include:</p>

        <h3>Supercomputer</h3>
        <p>Supercomputers are the fastest and most powerful computers, typically used for specialized tasks such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and rocket launching. They are very large, expensive, and not commercially used.</p>

        <h3>Mainframe Computer</h3>
        <p>Mainframe computers are large and fast, often used by corporations and government agencies for tasks like census data processing and large-scale record keeping. They have high processing power and large storage capacity.</p>

        <h3>Mini Computer</h3>
        <p>Mini computers are smaller than mainframes but still powerful, handling more input and output than microcomputers. They are used in medium-sized businesses, industries, and universities.</p>

        <h3>Micro Computer</h3>
        <p>Microcomputers are the smallest type of computer, using microprocessors as the central processing unit. They are low-cost and commonly used in homes, schools, and businesses. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> A personal computer typically placed on a desk, known for its versatility in various applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Laptop:</strong> A portable computer that can be carried easily. It is widely used by travelers and business people.</li>
